"notification.practiceDue.title" = "Time to Practise";
"notification.practiceDue.body.receive" = "Your receive training session is ready.";

// MARK: - Session History
// UK spelling for "practise" when used as verb
"Next practice dates have been recalculated from your valid session history." = "Next practise dates have been recalculated from your valid session history.";
