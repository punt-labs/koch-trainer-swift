For example, the 'Next Character' button on Learn Patterns (CharacterIntroductionView) only responds to taps near the text, not across the entire button width.\n\n## Observed Behavior\n- Tapping the edges of buttons does not register\n- Only tapping near/on the text label works\n- Affects multiple screens with similar button patterns\n\n## Code Analysis\nThe button styles in ButtonStyles.swift appear correct:\n- PrimaryButtonStyle and SecondaryButtonStyle use `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)`\n- Padding is applied to labels\n- Background colors cover the full area\n\nHowever, the actual tap behavior contradicts this. Possible causes:\n1. SwiftUI hit-testing not expanding with the frame\n2. Parent container constraints limiting hit area\n3. Missing `.contentShape(Rectangle())` modifier needed for transparent/bordered areas\n4. NavigationLink or other wrapper interfering with hit testing\n\n## Key Files to Investigate\n- KochTrainer/Design/Components/ButtonStyles.swift (lines 3-40)\n- KochTrainer/Views/Training/CharacterIntroductionView.swift (lines 59-70 - Next Character button)\n- Any view using SecondaryButtonStyle (bordered buttons with clear background)\n\n## Fix Approach\n1.
