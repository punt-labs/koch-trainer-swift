# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 19, 2026

Koch Trainer is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the app collects and how it is used.

## Data Collection

**Koch Trainer does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

All data is stored locally on your device:

- Practice progress and statistics
- App settings and preferences
- Practice streak history
- Your callsign (if entered)

### Callsign

You may optionally enter your amateur radio callsign in Settings. This is used only for QSO practice simulations within the app. Your callsign:

- Is stored locally on your device only
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party
- Can be deleted by clearing the field in Settings
- Is not verified or validated by the app

Note: Amateur radio callsigns are publicly linked to personal information (name, address) in government databases like the FCC ULS. We recommend only entering your callsign if you are comfortable with it being stored on your device.

## iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your app data may be included in your device backup. This is handled by iOS and allows your progress to transfer to a new device. We do not have access to your iCloud backups.

## Analytics and Tracking

Koch Trainer does not use any analytics services, tracking pixels, or third-party SDKs. There is no telemetry or usage data collection.

## Third-Party Services

Koch Trainer does not integrate with any third-party services. The app functions entirely offline.

## Children's Privacy

Koch Trainer does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Data Deletion

To delete all app data, use the "Reset All Progress" button in Settings, or delete the app from your device.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Effective Date" above and note the changes in the app's changelog.
